## Project Purpose
The main objectives of this project are:
- To design and create database tables using SQL.
- To perform data insertion, updating, and deletion operations.
- To execute various SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data.
- To implement and use SQL functions.
- To understand and apply relational database concepts.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
Throughout this project, I have gained and demonstrated skills in the following areas:
- **Database Design**: Structuring databases to efficiently store and retrieve data, ensuring normalization and referential integrity.
- **SQL Proficiency**: Writing and executing complex SQL statements for various operations including joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions.
- **Data Manipulation**: Performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage database records effectively.
- **SQL Functions**: Creating and using SQL functions to perform reusable operations.
- **Problem Solving**: Crafting queries to solve real-world data retrieval and analysis problems.
- **Database Management**: Creating, modifying, and dropping tables and other database objects to maintain database integrity and performance.

## Project Impact
This project has helped me:
- **Develop Practical Skills**: Applied theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, enhancing my understanding of database management.
- **Improve Efficiency**: Learned to write optimized queries for faster data retrieval.
- **Understand Data Relationships**: Gained a deeper understanding of how data is interconnected and how to leverage relationships in querying.
- **Utilize SQL Functions**: Improved my ability to write and use SQL functions to simplify complex queries and operations.

## Files Included
- `Toms_Wk7_CREATE.sql`: SQL script for creating database tables.
- `Toms_Wk7_DROP.sql`: SQL script for dropping database tables.
- `Toms_Wk7_INSERT.sql`: SQL script for inserting data into tables.
- `Toms_Wk7.FUNCTIONS.sql`: SQL script for creating and using SQL functions.

## Usage Instructions
To use these scripts, you can run them in your SQL environment (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.). Below are the general steps:

1. **Create Tables**:
    ```sql
    source Toms_Wk7_CREATE.sql;
    ```

2. **Insert Data**:
    ```sql
    source Toms_Wk7_INSERT.sql;
    ```

3. **Use Functions**:
    ```sql
    source Toms_Wk7.FUNCTIONS.sql;
    ```

4. **Drop Tables** (if needed):
    ```sql
    source Toms_Wk7_DROP.sql;
    ```
    
## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: Structured Query Language for database operations.
